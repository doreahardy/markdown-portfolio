* Raindrops on Roses
* Whiskers on Kittens
* Bright Copper Kettles
* Warm Woolen Mittens
* Brown paper packages tied up with string
* Cream-colored ponies
* Crisp apple strudels
* Doorbells and sleigh bells
* Schnitzel with noodles
* Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings
* Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes
* Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
* Silver-white winters that melt into springs
